# Auth Service

The **Auth Service** is responsible for securing the Vendo platform. It handles user authentication, authorization, token generation (JWT), One-Time Password (OTP) validation, password recovery, and Google OAuth integration.

This service acts as the security backbone, providing authentication tokens that clients use to interact with other microservices in the platform.

# Architecture

The service strictly follows **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** to isolate the core security and authentication logic from external frameworks, databases, and message brokers.

## Layers

**domain**
Contains the core business rules and models.

**application**
Contains the application use cases and orchestration logic.

**port**
Defines interfaces used to communicate with the outside world.

**adapter**
Implementations of external integrations.
* **adapter.in**: Entry points.
* **adapter.out**: Outgoing calls.

**infrastructure**
Framework-specific configurations and bean definitions.
* Configs for OpenAPI, Eureka, Kafka, OpenFeign, and MapStruct.

# Prerequisites

Before running this service, ensure the required infrastructure and core services are up.

## Dependencies

This service depends on:

- **Config Server** – provides externalized configuration
- **Service Registry (Eureka)** – for discovering `user-service`
- **Redis** – for storing temporary OTPs
- **Kafka** – for publishing email notification events
- **User Service** – requires synchronous communication via OpenFeign to fetch/verify user profiles
